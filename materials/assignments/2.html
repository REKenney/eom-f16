    <p>
      Sync all code deliverables to your github student repository, and all videos to YouTube by 6:30pm on the due date.

    <ol>
      <li>Choose an artist or designer you are inspired by. Gather 3-5 digital images (PNG/JPEG/GIF) of their work you find most inspiring. Upload to the Google Drive folder.</li>
      <li>Make a list of 3-5 reasons you find the chosen images inspiring. Do you like the colors, textures, scale, mood they use? Please also write the name of the artist or designer in the text file. Upload this list as any kind of text document or Google Doc to the Google Drive folder.</li>
      <li><p>
        
      Pick your favorite image. Create a Processing sketch inspired by 1 or 2 aspects of this image. Use only the Processing functions <code>point</code>, <code>line</code>, <code>ellipse</code>, <code>rect</code>, <code>fill</code>, <code>stroke</code>, <code>strokeWeight</code>, <code>background</code>, <code>size</code> and opacity. <b>Don't use any additional Processing features, this limitation will help you!</b>. Hint: you are not trying to copy or re-create the inspiration image, instead you are using attributes or aspects of the image to use as inspiration.</p>
      
      <p>Upload your final sketch to Google Drive. You may upload multiple variations if you desire. Don't use the export feature from the Processing menu, just Zip up your Sketch folder and upload that.</p>
