  <p>Choose an artist or designer you are inspired by. Gather 3-5 digital images of their work you find most inspiring. Make a list of 3-5 reasons you find the chosen images inspiring. Do you like the colors, textures, scale, mood they use?</p>  
  <p>Pick your favorite image. Create a Processing sketch inspired by 1 or 2 aspects of this image. Hint: you are not trying to copy or re-create the inspiration image, instead you are using attributes or aspects of the image to use as inspiration.</p>
  <p>Create <b>10</b> variations of your sketch, just but changing variables, constants, and random values.</p>
