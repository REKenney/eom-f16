    <h2>Theme</h2>
    <p>The theme this week is interactive experiences. Within experience design interaction allows users to influence a system. As a designer it is up to you to decide how much control you allow your users over the output of your system. You must strike a balance between carefully curating the experience versus allowing your users vast control. If you don't give your users enough control they may get bored, too much control and they might be overwhelmed or confused.</p>

    <h2>Drawing Tool/Toy</h2>
    <p>
      Using only the position of the mouse over time as input, create an algorithmic drawing tool/toy in Processing that creates a dynamic and engaging form-making experience while leaving an aesthetic result. Your sketch should be fun to play with, and fun to look at. Consider how much randomness should be placed within the work. Too little and your project may feel static and repetitive, too much and we may no longer feel like we are in control! Consider elements of user input (position, speed, delay) as they relate to visual properties (shape, line, color). Consider how global variables can be incremented to make change over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Hint: Start with one of the drawing tool examples and adapt and change it</span>. Note: You are welcome to use the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/mousePressed_.html">mousePressed()</a> and <a href="https://processing.org/reference/keyPressed_.html">keyPressed()</a> functions to add additional interest to your tool, or to clear your screen and start over.
