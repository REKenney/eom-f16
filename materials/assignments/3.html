    <h2>Interactive Poster</h2>
    <p>
      Design an “interactive poster” that could be installed in the MassArt Design &amp; Media Center Lobby. Assume your piece will be projected onto a wall, with a podium containing a mouse and keyboard. In traditional poster design, the designer seeks to quickly convey a message with a static visual image. Your assignment is to create a new kind of poster, an “interactive poster.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Using Processing and any of the skills you have learned create a sketch that will be displayed on the large monitor. You may use shapes, images, video, sound, etc… Like a poster your imagery and sound should entice and engage the user. Your “poster” must convey a message you find important. Topic ideas include but are not limited to: race/gender/economic equality, housing &amp; food access, global warming, women's reproductive rights, nuclear energy, war, gun violence, hunger, communication, virtual reality, etc…
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Requirements:</b> your sketch must take advantage of the mouse and keyboard and respond to input from a user. You may require as little or as much interaction from the user as you desire.      
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to pick a different location (than MassArt) if you have one in mind.
