    <h2>Data Driven Design</h2>
    <p>For this assignment you will be choosing a meaningful dataset and creating a static or interactive data visualization with it. In the design world, data visualization means to communicate aspects of a dataset through visuals and text. In the art world designing with data can be more abstract, a dataset can simple be used to influence some visual aspects of a visual design. It is up to you to take either approach, or something in between.</p>
    <p>Consider typography (choice of font, font size), color (color of fonts, color of graphical elements), size (emphasis, comparison), icons, shape (comparison). Think about themes, should the content of the data influence the aesthetics of the visualization? Change your dataset, how does this influence your visuals? As numbers increase in your dataset, what happens in your visuals? As numbers decrease, how does this affect your visuals?

    <p>
      Make several revisions. Feel free to take inspiration from other examples including those from <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/code">Generative Design</a> <a href="https://github.com/generative-design/Code-Package-Processing-2.x/archive/master.zip">(zip)</a> but make sure to use ones that are data-driven like (M_5_3_01, M_5_4_01).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Run your visualization at least <b>3</b> times with differing data. You do not need to download different datasets, you can just manually update the numbers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save your sketch into <b>3</b> different folders so that we may easily run your sketches and see how they differ with differing data. Only the dataset will differ, you do not need to update your code.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Submit all <b>versions</b> to <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> by 5pm on due date.
