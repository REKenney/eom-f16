  <p>Go outside. Observe your surroundings, and identify and document (photos, video, drawing) a pattern of movement or change over time repeated by many members of the same group of objects/ people/ flora/ fauna. Traffic. Migrating birds. Schooling fish. Leaves falling. Leaves changing color. Rocks rolling down a slope. Grass growing.</p>
  <p>Sketch what it looks like. Think about the forms you’re observing, and the nature of their motion, visual changes, and speed.</p>
  <p>Create a Processing sketch that visually represents your chosen real-world movement or change. Within your sketch at least 100 individual elements must move or change in a coordinated and aesthetically interesting manner. Make your Sketch responsive to user interaction, or not.</p>
