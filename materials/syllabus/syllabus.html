  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>Elements of Media is a graduate-level studio elective focused upon developing a foundational understanding of the complex synthesis of visual, aural, and temporal information within dynamic media. Through in-class demonstration students will learn the technological and programmatic processes necessary to begin creating visual explorations in image, sound, and interaction. The critical analysis of these explorations, combined with examples and readings, will serve as tools to develop a basic design gram- mar for communication within dynamic media.
    <em>Prerequisites:</em> none.
  </p>

  <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn the foundational concepts of programming</li>

  </ul>
  
  <h2>Grading</h2>
  <p>In all projects and exercises, the quality of translation of conceptualized interactions and visuals into functional prototypes via code will be the primary element to be evaluated. Additionally, students will be evaluated for the depth of their discovery process, and their ability to test and refine ideas and solicit feedback from users to create elegant, functional final deliverables.</p>
  <p>Students' final course grades will be calculated based on the assessment properties listed above combined with the following: participation in discussions and studio exercises, attendance, on-time delivery of work, personal improvement during the course, craftsmanship and presentation skills, helpfulness to other students in the class, and quality of process. Your end-of-semester grade will be based <b>75%</b> on completed projects and <b>25%</b> on class participation, attendance, and attitude.</p>

  <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
  <p>Students in the Graphic Design Department must maintain a minimum C+ average in their required major courses each semester to proceed in the major. Students whom the faculty feel would benefit from a check-in of their progress may receive written notice
    of a mid-semester review for the following semester. This is not a formal review, and no special action is required of students - faculty will write up an evaluation based on the current coursework and performance of the students being reviewed.</p>
  <p>Students who do not achieve a minimum C+ average in their major courses are considered to be on departmental probation. Any course in which a student on departmental probation receives a C or below must be retaken. Due to the sequential nature of the
    Graphic Design program’s courses, this may entail taking a “special program” until the required course in question is offered again the following year. Such a special program will be designed by the chair on a case-by-case basis. If the grades of
    a student on probation fall below a C+ average a second time, the student is subject to dismissal from the program.</p>
  <p>Students at all levels are allowed to repeat a semester or year only once in the program, after which they will be dismissed from the major.</p>
  <p>Reviews in Graphic Design occur twice a year - in December and in May. Review times are posted in the Design Office the week before reviews. Review performance is factored into students’ final course grades by their instructors. Students are required
    to attend their reviews. Lateness of more than 5 minutes beyond the posted review time is considered missing the review. Missing a review without written proof of a medical or family emergency is grounds for failing all required courses.</p>

  <h2>Attendance</h2><p>During the first week of classes, faculty state clearly their expectations for performance and attendance, their method of recording attendance, and their expectations for makeup work and examinations. All students must attend the first day of classes for which they are registered to reserve a place in the course. If a student cannot attend because of illness or other emergency, he or she must email faculty before the first class meeting to inform the faculty member of their absence. A student who misses the first meeting of a class without notice may be dropped from the roster by the instructor. Students are expected to attend all classes. Faculty have the right to assign an "F" or "NC" grade to a student who attends less than 80 percent of the meetings of any course. There are no formally excused absences for any reason, including illness. However, a student who will miss one or two classes may be able to make up missed work, at the discretion of each instructor. If a student will miss one or two classes due to illness, he or she should notify all current faculty members by e-mail. For absences of two or more class meetings due to illness, the student may contact the director of counseling to request a leave of absence.</p>

  <h2>Students with Disabilities Statement</h2><p>Massachusetts College of Art and Design is committed to fostering the academic, personal, and professional growth of all our students with a variety of resources for their success.  We are committed to ensuring that students with documented disabilities, as defined under the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), are provided equal access to all campus resources and opportunities.</p>
  <p>If you believe you have a disability that may warrant accommodations, I urge you to contact the Academic Resource Center (ARC) Tower 8th floor, at 617-879-7280 or by email at <a href="mailto:arc@massart.edu">arc@massart.edu</a>.  The Academic Resource Center provides support to all students as well as access to a disability coordinator, academic coaches and writing specialists.</p>
  <p>Please check with the Bookstore about the availability of digital-audio versions of the assigned texts or readings in this course. If they are not available, or if you need additional materials in the digital-audio format, please contact the Academic Resource Center to assist you.  It can take three (3) to four (4) weeks to secure digital-audio materials that are not available through our library network.</p>

  <h2>Grading System</h2>
  <p>Two grading systems are used at the college: Letter grades (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F, Incomplete, W) are given in the following courses: Liberal Arts, Art Education, Fashion Design, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Animation, Illustration, and Architectural Design, and History of Art   Pass/ No Credit / Incomplete/ W grades are given in the following courses: First year studio courses (Studio Foundation - SFDN), Film/Video, Photography, Studio for Interrelated Media, Fine Arts 2D - Painting, Printmaking, Fine Arts 3D - Ceramics, Fibers, Glass, Jewelry/Metalsmithing, Sculpture</p>

  <h2>Grade Definitions</h2>
  <ul class="grades">
    <li><span class="grade">A</span> Exceptional work in all respects. </li>
    <li><span class="grade">B</span> Above average work, distinguished in certain but not all respects.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">C</span> Average.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">C-</span> Below average</li>
    <li><span class="grade">D</span> Lowest passing grade; individual departments may set standards for the application of "D" grades toward progress in the major.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">F</span> Failing work. No credit is given.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">Pass</span> Work meeting all expectations for successful completion of the course.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">NC</span> No Credit. Work that does not meet the expectations of the course.</li>
    <li><span class="grade">Inc</span> Incomplete. A temporary designation indicating that at least 80% of the course requirements have been met and that the remaining course requirements are expected to be completed, and a permanent designation issued by the subsequent mid-semester. The student is responsible for having an Individual Grade Sheet completed by the appropriate faculty member and filed with the registrar. If the student does not complete the course work, a non-passing grade will be issued after the midpoint of the following semester. </li>
    <li><span class="grade">W</span> Withdrawn from the course. No credit earned. W grades do not appear on the student's transcript.</li>
        
  </ul>
  <p>If a failing grade is received in a required course, students must take the course again and pass it. This rule does not apply to a student who changed majors and who did not pass requirements for a previous concentration.</p>

  <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
  <p>Plagiarism In creative work, plagiarism is the inappropriate and unethical representation of another's work as one's own. In those instances where a significant portion of a creative work is intentionally "appropriated," plagiarism is the failure to note, orally or in writing, the source of the appropriation. In expository or academic writing, whenever your work incorporates someone else's research, images, words, or ideas, you must properly identify the source unless you can reasonably expect knowledgeable people to recognize it. Proper citation gives credit where it is due and enables your readers to locate sources and pursue lines of inquiry raised by your paper. Students who do not comply may be penalized.</p>
